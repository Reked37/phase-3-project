Phase 3 Project -- Password Manager
- The purpose of creating this project was to enable people to save their username and passwords to a website
    in one place. The user can easily access their information by just tpying in the website and the CLI returns
    the user their login information.

Project Description
- The CLI is used to store login information to a website in one place.
    There is a user interface and a website interface that you are able to add, change, delete, and search for login detail, while
    the website allows you to add a non-existent website to the data tables to be able to add login details for that website.

Using The Project
- First off you will have to change directory to wherever the file is stored until you get to the file of "db" inside of library.
- Next, you'll want to run python3 ../cli.py to be able to run the command line application in which you are prompted to enter either "user" or "website."
- Entering the user interface will give you the option of adding, deleting, changing old info, or searching up a existing website login information.
- On the other hand, the website interface prompts the user to enter a new website to the data table to use for future login creditals.
